Depending on the type of opponent you choose, you will experience different things.

If you prefer to fight a fellow human:

	- You will face against another person. Both of you, after deciding on who
	who goes first, will face against each other
	- After each one of you selects a figther or creates one, you will start
	fighting via a minigame. Whoever goes down first, is the loser
	- A more detailed explanation can be inquired later on

Elif you prefer to fight the Nasty Java Console:

	- Instead of a human, you are going to face my creation: The Arrow Demon >:D
	- Depending on the overall rank of the fight, the difficulty will be adjusted
	- All actions that the Console takes are randomized. So be prepared for the unexpected!

Your Fighter statistics play an important role when clasing against other fighters.

	- Vitality: It will dictate the amount of Health Points (HP) that your Fighter has.
	The more Vitality Points (or HP) your fighter has, the harder it will be for it to 
	fall in combat.
	- Strength: It will dictate the amount of Damage per Hit that your Fighter can
	inflict to the opponent.
	- Dexterity: Dexterity has two bonuses. (1) Increase the time limit that you have
	to input your Arrow Keys during a Fighting Minigame. (2) A small chance, depending 
	on your Dexterity points, to dodge a blow coming from your opponent (negates taken
	damage that round).

You will be able to gain stat points throughout the game. Both victories and losses will grant
you a certain number of stat points. Keep in mind that defeats will yield a higher amount.
However if you lose fights, you are also going to lose Rank Points. 

So don't try anything funny!

Now you are going to either pick an already built Fighter or build a customized one. If you 
choose to do the latter, then your Fighter will start with 1 stat point in each statistic
and you will be responsible for allocating the points. 

Do not worry, in both cases you will have the same total stat points.
