Depending on the type of opponent you choose, you will experience different things.

If you prefer to fight a fellow human:

	- You will face against another person. Both of you, after deciding on who
	who goes first, will face against each other
	- After each one of you selects a figther or creates one, you will start
	fighting via a minigame. Whoever goes down first, is the loser
	- A more detailed explanation can be inquired later on

Elif you prefer to fight the Nasty Java Console:

	- Instead of a human, you are going to face my creation: The Arrow Demon >:D
	- Depending on the overall rank of the fight, the difficulty will be adjusted
	- All actions that the Console takes are randomized. So be prepared for the unexpected!
